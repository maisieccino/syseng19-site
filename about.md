<h3 class="section-header">Christopher Lau <span class="lead" style="font-size:25px;">- Team Leader</span></h3>
As team leader of this project, I will be in charge of the main communication with the Client and supervisors and ensuring that they are up to date with the progress of our development. This includes organising and managing bi-weekly meetings with the client and supervisor, writing bi-weekly reports regarding our milestones and achievements. For term 1, I was mainly in charge of managing the project website by adding content on our progress. My main interests are front-end web designing, machine learning and Internet of Things.
