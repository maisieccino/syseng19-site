# The Team
This project is being worked on by three UCL 2nd year Computer Science undergraduates as part of the COMP204P and COMP205P Systems Engineering Project modules.

## Christopher Lau <span class="lead" style="font-size:25px;">- Team Leader</span>
As team leader of this project, I will be in charge of the main communication with the Client and supervisors and ensuring that they are up to date with the progress of our development. This includes organising and managing bi-weekly meetings with the client and supervisor, writing bi-weekly reports regarding our milestones and achievements. My main interests are front-end web designing, machine learning and Internet of Things.
