                    <h3 class="section-header">Our Testing Methodology</h3>
<p>The way we tested our system varied considerably between the webapp 
and the API server. The development of the API largely followed a
Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD), which aligned well with the way
that our project was organised. The webapp, by its nature, is a lot
more difficult to unit test and thus we adopted an iterative process,
where a feature was developed and the developer used black-box testing
to make sure the feature worked.</p>

<a href="#compatibility-testing-section" style="margin-top: 7px;" class="btn btn-primary">Compatibility Testing</a></p>

<h3 class="section-header">API Testing</h3>

<p><span class="lead sub-header" id="automated-testing-section">Automated Testing Suite</span><br />
Because the API was developed using the Django framework, we were
able to use its own testing harness and mocking environment. This test
environment can create a test database on the fly, and mock web requests
if we so wish to automate testing of the real API endpoints without having
to power up an actual web server. In addition to this, the test harness
automatically bundled each test in a test case into a single database
transaction by default, meaning that the suite ran much faster than it
would otherwise.</p>

<p>There were three main types of test in the automated suite: model tests,
serializer tests, and API tests. The model tests acted like traditional
unit tests, which tested model methods to ensure that they returned the
correct value for a range of different inputs. The serializer tests
were used to make sure that user input was properly validated and that
the data serializers did not leak any private information (for instance,
passwords). Finally, the API tests mocked API calls to the server, to make
sure that the server could return the correct response code and data for a
range of scenarios. These tests were developed according to the API
specification, to make sure that the error codes were what an API consumer
would expect to receive.</p>

<p><span class="lead sub-header" id="integration-testing-section">Continuous Integration testing (CI)</span><br />
<img src="/2016/group19/assets/img/travis-ci.png" class="image" alt="node.js" height="100" width="250" /><br /></p>

<p>Thanks to these automated tests, we were able to set up a continuous
integration solution to ensure that new code did not break the existing
system. We chose Travis CI, because of its simple integration with
GitHub, where our code repository is stored. We configured Travis to
run the test suite as part of its test script, and set it up so that
tests would run on all commits and pull requests. We also modified the
GitHub repository settings so that code could not be pushed straight to
the master branch (all code had to be merged in via pull request), and
pull requests could not be merged into master unless the CI build passed.</p>

<p>Finally, to take this even further, we hooked up our CI system to the
development server, meaning that once code passed tests on the master
branch, a script would be run that deploys the code to our server,
performs any package installs and database migrations, then restarts
the server so that it’s running on the new code. This ties in partly
with the ‘dogfooding’ methodology that’s used on the web app development.
You can view all of our CI builds on the link below.</p>

<p><span class="lead sub-header" id="black-box-testing-section">Manual Black-Box Testing</span><br />
<img src="/2016/group19/assets/img/postman.png" class="image" alt="node.js" height="100" width="100" /><br /></p>

<p>Often, to ensure our tests were working correctly, we’d perform manual
black-box testing. This would involve making API calls in the same manner
as a real API consumer, and check that the output received was what was
expected. For this, we normally used the <code>Postman</code> app, or <code>cURL</code>. Using
Postman, we could simulate the entire authentication flow, and test
actions like signing up for mentorship programmes.</p>

<h3 class="section-header">Web Application Testing</h3>

<p><span class="lead sub-header" id="user-acceptance-testing-section">User Acceptance Testing</span><br />
We have conducted two major user acceptance test with our client to ensure that our client is satisfied with our progress before we continue our development. For both UATs, meetings were organised so that we could explain to the client how what are the features we have implemented so that we don’t miss anything out.</p>

<p><span class="lead sub-header">User Acceptance Test 1 (08/02/2017)</span><br />
<strong>Interactive prototype feedback</strong> – Before we started developing our application during term 2, we decided to let our client take a look at our interactive prototype which was created using Ionic Creator which was a prototyping tool that allowed us to build simple prototypes which rich Ionic user interface features.</p>

<p>The goal of showing her our prototype was to allow our client to have a grasp of how the look and feel of the real application would look like during development. Our client was satisfied with our prototype and also the video we provided which includes a small demonstration of our prototype and our proof of concept.</p>

<p><span class="lead sub-header">User Acceptance Test 2 (05/04/2017)</span><br />
<strong>Full-scale user acceptance test</strong> – At this point we have made significant progress in our application and have implemented most of the key features and requirements requested by our client. We decided to update our client with our progress and also allow our client to test out all of the features we have implemented and also detect any bugs so that we can work to fix them. 
The team found that the UAT was very successful and the client was really satisfied with what we have produced so far. Below is a table of the list of features that was tested by the client and its results.</p>

<div class="table-responsive decisionTable">

		    </tr>
		    <tr>
		       	<td>Cohort Management (Admin)</td>

		    <tr>
		       	<td>Cohort Registration</td>
		        <td>Users can only register if cohort is active, successfully tested by client. Users can choose to sign up as mentor or mentee, and search interest ‘tags’ from more than 20 interest. This was also successful. There was a minor bug the client noticed when registering as a mentee where the client got ‘stuck’ in the App. This was a minor fix and was fixed immediately.</td>

<p><span class="lead sub-header" id="compatibility-testing-section">Compatibility Testing (Mobile Devices)</span><br />
<img src="/2016/group19/assets/img/ionic-view-logo.png" class="image" alt="node.js" height="100" width="250" /><br /></p>

<p>In order to ensure that our application was able to run on all mobile platforms, we used <code>Ionic View</code> to test our application on different devices when implementing new features. During development, we hosted the app locally on a chrome web browser by using Chrome developer tools to emulate the screen-size of different devices.</p>

<p>However, Ionic View allowed us to host our apps and share them with others so that other team members and our client can see the results of the newly implemented features on their mobile devices. We have tested our app on different mobile platforms such as IOS and Android. Below are some of the screen-shots of the app on both IOS and Android devices.</p>
