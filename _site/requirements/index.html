<!-- Client, problem definition -->
<h3 class="section-header" id="client-section">Our Client</h3>
<p><strong>Atos</strong> is a leader in digital services. Serving a global client base, Atos provides Consulting &amp; Systems Integration services, Managed Services &amp; BPO, Cloud operations, Big Data &amp; Cyber-security solutions, as well as transactional services through Worldline, the European leader in the payments and transactional services industry.</p>
<p>Atos are also focused on business technology that powers progress and helps organizations to create their firm of the future. The client we are working with is based at the Nottingham Office.</p>

<h3 class="section-header">Problem Definition</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Atos is a large firm consisting of multiple employees of different skillset and age group working in various departments.</li>
  <li>Our client wanted a way that would allow employees in their workplace to help improve each other’s skillset.</li>
  <li>Our cliet proposed an application that would pair up mentors who are experienced employees with newer employees which acts as their mentees.</li>
  <li>The client also addressed the stable marriage problem which is the problem of finding stable matching between the sample size of mentors and mentees.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="section-header">Stable Marriage Problem</h3>
<p>The stable marriage problem marriage problem is the problem of finding a stable matching between two equally sized sets of elements given an ordering of preferences for each element. This problem can be modeled by using the employees as an example where there are equal number of employees willing to act as mentors and similarly apply to become a mentee.</p>

<p>Currently the process of matching a mentor and mentee is done manually by human resources in Atos. Our client wanted an application that does this automatically and is also able to handle non-perfect data size such as when the number of mentors and mentees differ.</p>

<!-- Requirements section -->

<h3 class="section-header" id="moscow-requirements-section">Requirements Gathering</h3>
<p>Before constructing our MosCoW requirements, we decided to communicate as much with our client as possible to ensure that we agree on the list of requirements and deliverables the application must provide by the end of term. We initially drafted a list of requirements during our first meeting with our client when she briefed us about the problem definition and what was expected from us.</p>

<p>After making a draft of the requirements, we constantly emailed our client to get feedback and finalised a list of MosCoW requirements during a meeting.</p>

<h3 class="section-header">MosCoW Requirements</h3>
<p>This is a list of all the requirements as agreed and finalised with our client. These requirements are subject to change over the course of the development phase of this project.</p>
