<p>In the first day of meeting we set up an facebook group for cmmunicate between each other and share our ideas.</p>

<p>##Trello</p>

<p>trello is a collabration tool that organizes our projects on several boards.
In our team we divided boards into three parts: Backlog, In progress and Completed. We created tasks by making boards and then added it into Backlog part, in each task we assign the due date, members responsible for this task and add labels on it. Once we start working on this task the board would be moved into in progress part. We agreed to take maximum 6 tasks in progress.</p>

<p>##Github</p>

<p>Github is a version-control service based on git. Our team built three github repositories: one for project’s documents, one for project’s codes, one for project’s website. Through github each team member could work separately on same project in a time by making branches of master branch and send pull requst to merge each one’s work. Also the version control through github could help us to review our work thus find problems in previous work.</p>

<p>##Google Drive</p>

<p>All of our documentations( include bi-weekly report, researches, design works) are shared in google drive  before we converted it into Latex or put in on website.</p>

        <p class="card-text"><h3 class="section-header">Overcoming the Stable Marriage Problem</h3>
<p>After researching online regarding solutions to the Stable Marriage Problem, we found that applying the <strong>Gale-Shapley Algorithm</strong> would be an effective way to find a stable match between mentors and mentees.</p>

<p>The Gale-Shapley Algorithm involves a number of iterations or “rounds” where mentees are able to choose a fixed number of prefered mentors ordered by rank. Then the system will match mentors and mentees based on how suitable the match is between a mentor and mentee. By using this algortihm, we can ensure that every mentees gets matched with a mentor and no one is unpaired. A more detailed design of thhe matching process is available at the Architecture Research and Design section.</p>

<h3 class="section-header">Existing Solutions</h3>
<p>We searched for some existing applications that does matching between individuals as part of the initial stages of research. This helped us gain a basic idea of some features that we may like to include in our final product.</p>

<p><span class="lead sub-header">Mentor Match</span><br />
<strong>Mentor Match</strong> is an existing open source website that had a very similar concept to what our client was trying to acheive. Mentor Match is open to everyone and allows individuals with experience in a particular skillset to act as mentors to help mentees improve on that particular skillset.
Since this website is open to everyone, it makes exchange of knowledge very simple as anyone could take part in it.</p>

<p>However, there are certain features that the website lacks in terms of security as there is no verification as there is no way to assure that users applying to be a mentor has the skillset to become one. Also there were different types of mentor schemes requested by our client which differ with the schemes provided on the Mentor Match website. Despite the differences in structure of this website with the web application we are about to build, Mentor Match could be a useful guideline on the basic foundation of our web application.</p>

<p><span class="lead sub-header">Dating Applications</span><br />
Dating applications may not be the most professional apps to be used in a workplace, however the concept of these types of application is very similar to what was requested by our client. Our Client even quoted that this application “could be considered a kind of dating app”. Most dating applications have simple and elegent user interfaces that users can act easily with. This could be applied to our application so that employees in Atos workplace can use our application with ease. Concepts such as user profiles, notifications, instant messaging could be included in our application which already exist in dating applications.</p>
