# Mentor Match
[Link](https://www.mentormatch.org.uk/)

Mentor Match is an website for UK Civil Servants opens up the search beyond your immediate circle of contacts, helping you find the best people, quickly. Matching based on:
1. who you are,
2. what you’re good at
3. what you’d like to be better at

Information needed:
1. Name, email, where you based
2. current grade and current role
3. profession(select), skills
4. specific goal you want to achieve

In personal profile, it includes:
1. Areas you would like to develop (select an area)
2. Experience you can offer (select an area and a level you currently at)
3. Matching preferences: prefered contact type, You would like to be involved with(One-off advice sessions,Longer term mentoring) What is the minimum grade you would like your mentor to be?

## What we could learn from this project
The sign up page and information required to complete are simple and efficiently. The profile of user (current role, about, goals,profession and skills) is easy to edit also the essential information needed for matching are included. Thats what we could use to complete our client’s requirement (simple user profile).

# Business Mentoring
[Link](http://www.management-mentors.com/products/corporate-mentoring-products-overview)

Matching based on:
1. Focus areas/ competencies: There system have 25 default competencies to choose. (useful)
2. Forced choice questions:Provide questions that have several answers to select. Make the preferences of matching more specific. (useful)
3. Personality test:(optional)
4. Ranking of key roles: In this section, mentorees must decide what type of mentor they want based on how they order the following roles: teacher, sponsor, cheerleader, counselor, and friend (meaning if they put "cheerleader" first and "counselor" last, it's more important that the mentor is a cheerleader than a friend). Mentors must decide the type of mentor they want to be and do the same thing, ranking the roles in order of most important to least. (useful)
5. Essay section (not useful)

They also provide system matching:
1. Auto matching: makes matches based on algorithm without any review. 
2. three-steps-matching (also combines human touch, not 100% system matching): 
   * Program manager choose 3 tentative mentors for individual mentee.
   * Comparing mentoring forms(inforamtion) of the mentee with each mentor
   * The program manager makes the final choice

What we could learn from this project:

As the result of precise matching algorithm,this application has high percentage of successful matching (90% according to its website). From my research, the division of focus areas and ranking of key roles play an important role in matching, thats what we could follow in our app, give a list of skills as tags for user to choose.
