different groups with different requirements

3 groups with option to add more - don't hardcode this

~60 people in talent program, could be higher for others

*stable marriage problem*

kinda like a dating site problem

same people may/may not be available, max. no of mentees per mentor, status of pairing..?

example: one person has three mentees out their maximum of three. one may be actively meeting, one may not have started meeting, one may have just left scheme

open window for two weeks to apply, and then the system matches mentors to mentees.. what about surplus mentees? could happen multiple times in a year
user could be both mentor and mentees, depending on mentorship programme constraints

admin function for bulk CRUD operations

web app is probably best. app is for internal use only. system picks matches, users do not.

examples of preferences etc will be emailed over

## features?
must be easy to use, easy to enter matching preferences

would like to do it on laptop or phone

notifications would be "brilliant"

something that could be looked at

status, record of meetings... nice to have.

prompts to meet if there hasn't been activity.

user profile idea "good", needs to be fairly simple so that the user doesn't get invested in working on the profile rather than other things. clearly low priority. focus on the users' skills.

internal DB? SAP or there's a "corporate directory"
could use to populate profile, but best to check as these things tend to be locked down

## Requirements

MUST HAVE:
* matching system
* preferences for matching
* separate programs with their own requirements
* status of each persons' matches
SHOULD HAVE:
* profile system
* notifications
* admin - bulk create/read/update/write (CRUD) operations
COULD HAVE:
* recording meetings of mentorship
* prompts to meet
WOULD HAVE
* corporate directory lookup

mentor can't be line manager -> not the same team is easiest way?

## Next steps
finalise requirements (our side) by 14th October. Jane will then confirm this after weekend.
Create user stories

Are we using agile...?
