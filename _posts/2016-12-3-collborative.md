##Facebook Messanger:
In the first day of meeting we set up an facebook group for cmmunicate between each other and share our ideas.


##Trello:
trello is a collabration tool that organizes our projects on several boards.
In our team we divided boards into three parts: Backlog, In progress and Completed. We created tasks by making boards and then added it into Backlog part, in each task we assign the due date, members responsible for this task and add labels on it. Once we start working on this task the board would be moved into in progress part. We agreed to take maximum 6 tasks in progress.


##Github:
Github is a version-control service based on git. Our team built three github repositories: one for project’s documents, one for project’s codes, one for project’s website. Through github each team member could work separately on same project in a time by making branches of master branch and send pull requst to merge each one’s work. Also the version control through github could help us to review our work thus find problems in previous work. 


##Google Drive:
All of our documentations( include bi-weekly report, researches, design works) are shared in google drive  before we converted it into Latex or put in on website.
