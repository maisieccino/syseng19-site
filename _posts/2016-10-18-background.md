# Brief
The brief for our project is to create a system that matches mentors and mentees on behalf of Atos. The system will allow employees to sign up to various company programmes as either a mentor or a mentee, and then once applications are closed the system will use the users' profiles (as well as any constraints the program has) to find the most suitable mentor-mentee matchings.

The brief was deliberately left as open-ended as possible, to allow us to focus on completing the problem rather than working with an unfamiliar technology stack.

## User Interface Considerations
When meeting our client for the first time, she was favourable of the system being accessible from both her smartphone and laptop/desktop PC. So naturally we decided that a web app would be the best fit for this project. Whether this was to use Angular, Ionic, Meteor or some other framework had not been decided at this point.

Other things to consider included the possibility of receiving notifications, either in the form of push notifications from the app itself, SMS messages sent to a mobile phone, or emails.
