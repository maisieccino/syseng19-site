__MORE__

With a finalized set of requirements along with completed designed of our architecture and matching algorithm, our next goal for the second term is to develop our application based on the specified requirements and constraints. We will be developing functionalities and features in the order we prioritized in our MoSCoW requirements. We will also be implementing the user interface based on the first prototype we have created. We will also be splitting roles on team members who will be responsible for developing the frontend and backend.

Also, we will continue to use the SCRUM agile development process to manage the process with weekly sprints to ensure that progress is on track. We will also have regular meetings with our client to show our progress in different stages of development and take into account their feedback. We might also be planning on preparing short user acceptance tests before every client meeting, so that all new features we develop during a sprint go through a formal approval process.
