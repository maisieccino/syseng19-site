<h3 class="section-header">Facebook Messenger</h3>
During our first meeting we decided to set up a facebook messenger group as the main tool for communication between each other. We used Facebook Messenger as the main platform to share our ideas and help each other with any problems.

<h3 class="section-header">Trello</h3>
Trello is a collabration tool that organizes our projects on several boards. In our team we divided boards into three parts: Backlog, In progress and Completed. We create tasks by making boards and then add it into the Backlog section, for every task we assign a due date, members responsible for that task and add labels on it to indicate urgency. Once we start working on a task the card would be moved into the in progress section. The team agreed to take a maximum of 6 tasks in progress every week.

<h3 class="section-header">Github</h3>
Github is a version-control service based on git. Our team built three github repositories: one for documentation, main code repository, one repository for the project website. Through github each team member could work separately on same project simultaneously by making branches of master branch and send pull requst to merge each oneâ€™s work. Also the version control through github could help us to review our work thus find problems in previous work.

<h3 class="section-header">Google Drive and Google Docs</h3>
All of the documentation we have completed so far (which includes bi-weekly reports, research, design) are shared in google drive before converting it into Latex for submission or adding the content to the project website.
