Project site for systems engineering project.

# Setup
You'll need Node.JS and Ruby. Then you'll need to install Gulp, the task manager.

`npm i -g gulp`

Then you'll need Bundler.

`gem install bundler`

Install the Ruby dependencies.

`bundle intsall`

Then install the Node dependencies.

`npm i`

Finally, you can run the build server:

`gulp`

# Site Content

All html files for the webpages are available in the '_site' directory. These are autogenerated and must not be changed. An individual view of every webpage can be seen in these html files, but its best to view our full website at http://students.cs.ucl.ac.uk/2016/group19/ or install jekyll in your PC and host the website locally.

Steps on how to install jekyll are available here https://jekyllrb.com/docs/quickstart/ . To view our website download or clone the github repo provided and run 'jekyll serve' on the command line. Note that your current directory must be the root of the github repository of the site. The server address should be displayed when 'jekyll serve' is run and copy it to your web browser to host the site locally.

# Editing things

Don't edit anything in the `_site` directory! That's the site automatically generated by Jekyll. Posts are modified in the `_posts` directory, and use the markdown format. Have a look at existing ones to see what to do.

Site information is stored in `_config.yml`.
